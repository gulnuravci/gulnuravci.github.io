                    <p>You can search for a list of subreddits that include a specific word in the subreddit's name or description, and the Reddit API will give you a list of subreddits that match this criteria. As a first attempt at filtering out subreddits related to the parent companies, I wrote a function that filtered the relevant subreddits for each parent company based on how many of the keywords in that parent company's keywords list were contained in the name and description of the subreddit. </p>

                    <p>This technique filters what might be seen as a substantial amount of subreddits (the resulting list of subreddits about 1/3 the original subreddit count). However, a lot of unrelated subreddits slipped through the cracks. For example, if I set my function to filter the subreddits based on whether one keyword in the keyword list matches its title/description, I will get a lot of unrelated subreddits such as "appletrees" for Apple. If I set the function to match on more keywords, the search criteria is too narrow and almost none of the subreddits will match.</p>

                    <p>To recap, there are relevant subreddits for each parent company, a number of posts extracted for each subreddit, and a number of comments extracted for each post. In my sentiment calculation, I related the sentiment of each individual posts along with its comments in the following manner.</p>
                    <p>Firstly, text classification models often give you a a percentage score between 0 and 1 in the categories it is classifying under. So let's say a classification model is classifying whether a text is positive, negative, or neutral. It gives you a percentage score between 0 and 1 for each category, and the one with the highest percentage is often what you take as the guess of the model. For example, the statement "I love you" could have a positive sentiment score of 0.99, negative sentiment score of 0.01, and neutral sentiment score of 0.0. You would take the highest sentiment score as the classification for that text.</p>
                    <p>There is nuance in these scores. A post with 10,000 upvote ratio vs. a post with 100 upvote ratio should be included in the average sentiment accordingly. So for each post and comment group, I get a sentiment score for each entry. If the text is classified as positive, I take the sentiment percentage as a positive (+) number, whereas if its classified as negative, I take the sentiment percentage as a negative (-) number. If the text is classified as neutral, regardless of what the sentiment percentage is, I take the the score as zero (0). I multiply each sentiment score by the interactions (aka upvote ratio) for that entry, sum up these values for the posts and its comments, and divide it by the total interactions for the entries in that post/comment group. This gives a singular average sentiment score for that group.</p>
                    <p>The sign of the average score determines if that interaction was considered positive or negative, and its magnitude determines how postive/negative it was. Neutral scores don't contribute to the sentiment score, but the interactions on the neutral entry do. For example, if there is a post that has severe negative sentiment but a comment that is classified neutral gets a lot of upvotes, the average sentiment for that interaction might be in the negative direction but it's magnitude will be diminished by the amount of interactions the neutral entry received. </p>

                    <p>Calculating the average sentiment of each company was elementary, you simply sum up all the individual average sentiments found amongst groups of post and their comments, and divide it by the number of groups there are for that company.</p>

                    <p>The classifications were overwhelmingly neutral to the point where there were a handful of positive/negative classifications among a 1,000 posts and comments. This is why the financial sentiment analysis model was ruled out for this project, since saying all the posts are neutral doesn't give us much insight into people's opinions. This did reveal that people don't talk in an overwhelmingly financial tone even on technology related subreddits, which was interesting to see.</p>

                    <p>This model resulted in a much better distribution of sentiments, where there were similar amounts of positive and negative sentiments, and much less neutral sentiments than before.

                <img src="../../../images/Reddit_Sentiment_Analysis/reddit-hugging-face.gif" width="250px">
                <div class="post-content-description">
                    <p>The last step was to combine the Google Colab research code in a digestable manner and deploy it as a tool that can be used by the public.</p>
                    <p>Reddit now sells the usage of their API to companies to do AI research, so you either have to obtain proper permissions to do a lot of requests, or the API will slow down your calls to not exceed the limit. This is why the number of posts per subreddit and comments per post, while being an adjustable parameter, should remain reasonable or the user will have to wait an excessive amount of time for results and the program might time out on them with random "Access denied" errors.</p>
                    <p>I set it up so that when a user requests the plots for today, if the request was within 24 hours of the last extraction of data, it returns the plots based on those results. If it has been more than 24 hours, the user's request can take atleast 30 mins based on the number of posts/comments being requested. If you are using the tool for research purposes, I'd say just set the tab aside after your request and just wait for it to finish because even if it takes a long time the request does come to completion eventually. If you are not the first user to make a request that day, you will get your results in seconds.</p>
                    <p>One last thing, daily results will be stored in a dataset at <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/gulnuravci/reddit_sentiment_analysis_results">gulnuravci/reddit_sentiment_analysis_results</a> on the Hugging Face platform, so additional research can be done on how Reddit users' sentiment changed with market movements. </p>
